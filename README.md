Welcome to the FinEdge repository! This repository contains the code for a single-page website designed for a fictitious fintech startup called "FinEdge."

Design and Development Process
The website is built using HTML and CSS, providing a simple and intuitive user interface. The single-page design allows visitors to navigate through different sections smoothly, providing information about FinEdge's mission, services, and contact details.

The development process involved the following steps:

HTML Structure: The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the website, including sections for the home, about, services, and contact.

CSS Styling: The CSS files (style.css and responsive.css) contain the styles and layout rules to enhance the visual appearance and responsiveness of the website across different devices.

Navigation: The navigation bar allows users to jump to different sections of the website smoothly.

Contact Form: The website features a simple contact form for visitors to submit their inquiries or concerns.

Challenges Encountered and Resolutions :

During the development process, a few challenges were encountered:

Responsive Design: Ensuring that the website is visually appealing and functional across various screen sizes and devices was a challenge. To overcome this, the responsive design approach was implemented using CSS media queries to adapt the layout and styling based on different screen sizes.
Optimizing Images: The use of images in the website could potentially impact performance if they are not properly optimized. To address this, the images were compressed and resized appropriately to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing quality.
Accessibility: It is important to ensure that the website is accessible to users with disabilities. To improve accessibility, appropriate alt text was added to images, and semantic HTML tags were used to provide a clear structure for screen readers.

Usage
To use the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The website will load, and you can navigate through the different sections using the links in the navigation bar.

Conclusion
The FinEdge Fintech Startup repository contains the code for a single-page website showcasing the services and mission of the fictitious fintech startup, FinEdge. The website is designed to provide a seamless user experience and is built using HTML and CSS.
